# No longer actively maintained
I currently have no interest in Garry's Mod 13, so this mod is naturally no longer maintained. You are free to modify the mod and redistribute it, however I would like you to tell me whenever you do so. I like to keep track of my mods and see what awesome work can be done.

I had a lot of plans for this mod, so maybe I will continue to work on it in the future.

**Update:** I will however continue to fix bugs, so please report them if you find one. I will not add new features.

Have fun!
